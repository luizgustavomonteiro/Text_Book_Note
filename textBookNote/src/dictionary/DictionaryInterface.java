//EXPLANATION

/*An interface specifies which methods you need to implement inside a class. 
This shows the design, and the developer needs to follow it. 
This practice is good for generalizing things or characteristics. 
When creating the class, it is necessary to define all the methods specified in the interface. 
If you want to create another class, this practice is good for scalability. 
Every method in an interface is abstract; itâ€™s similar to a class, but all the methods are abstract by default.
